# Setup
All you need is Golang and gcc compilator. To build just run `go build .` and you will get executable.<br>
Before running executable setup config. Replace null in endpoints to ["endpoint1", "endpoint2"].<br>
To load your accounts you need to put private keys to accounts.txt near executable.

# Issues
I'm newbie in development so its not suprise if there will be some issues. If you find one, please contact me or just open issue here.
